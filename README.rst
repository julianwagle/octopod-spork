Powered by Cookiecutter_, Octopod Spork is a framework for jumpstarting
production-ready Django projects quickly.


Overview
---------
Octopod Spork is a spin off of Cookiecutter Django. It is customized for my workflow and includes features such as gis tools, web scraping tools, data science tools, celery voulumes, and a bare bones react app.

Usage
------

First, get Cookiecutter. Trust me, it's awesome::

    $ pip install "cookiecutter>=1.7.0"

Now run it against this repo::

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/julianwagle/octopod-spork

You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them, then a project will be created for you.

Finally, move to the root directory and enter the following:

    $ docker-compose -f local.yml up
    
You should now be able to navigate to either port 8000 for a classic Django project or port 3000 for a React based front-end. Enjoy!
